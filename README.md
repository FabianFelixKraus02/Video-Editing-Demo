# Video-Editing-Demo
A brief demo for a Video Editor using React + WebAssembly

Problem: Editing a video is better using C/C++ than JavaScript since it is CPU intensive. 

Solution: The FFmpeg library is a good choice for this task, but is written in C. We use WebAssembly to run that code in the Web Browser. We do not need a backend with that solution.
